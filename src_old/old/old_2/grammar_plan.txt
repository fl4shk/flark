Expressions
	* Support both HDL expressions and software expressions in same parser.

Functions
	* Support both HDL functions and software functions in same parser.
	Software function syntax can be used in both HDL runtime code and HDL
	compile-time code.

Custom Types
	* Support both HDL classes and software classes in same parser.
	Specify, in pt visitor, if it's a valid HDL *runtime* class.
	* Usability of custom types at both HDL runtime and HDL compile-time is
	*entirely based upon member variables, not member functions*.  This
	permits storing functions only executable at HDL compile-time and
	functions only executable at HDL runtime in the same class.  This can
	be useful if compile-time code execution provides the initial value of
	a class instance, for example.  It can also be useful for testing
	purposes.
